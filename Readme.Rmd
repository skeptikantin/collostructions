## {collostructions}

The R package {collostructions} is an R implementation for collostructional analysis. The package contains functions to perform Simple, Distinctive, and Co-Varying Collexeme Analyses, as well as some useful functions for transformation and the creation of frequency lists. There are sample data sets for all functions with documentation. The package is discussed in Episode X of my R tutorial, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZN-827NSIONkLPWpjaFr0mlKacSLTRy).
