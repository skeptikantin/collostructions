## {collostructions}

{collostructions} is an R implementation for collostructional analysis. The package contains functions to perform Simple, Distinctive, and Co-Varying Collexeme Analyses, as well as some useful functions for transformation and the creation of frequency lists. There are sample data sets for all functions with documentation.

## Usage

### Installation

If you want to install from this gitub source, 

```
library(devtools)
install_github('skeptikantin/collostructions')
```


### Tutorial

The package is discussed in Episode X of my R tutorial, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIZN-827NSIONkLPWpjaFr0mlKacSLTRy). The tutorial was done with a previous version, which does not include all functions that are now available, but the basic principle remains the same.
